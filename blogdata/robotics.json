    "content": "Robots have a long history, dating back to ancient Greece; notably, the first digital-operated and programmable robot debuted in the mid-twentieth century. Robotics quickly took over key industries like automotive manufacturing, with early spot welding robot prototypes used in General Motors facilities in 1961. Throughout the years, robotics has developed increasingly sophisticated machines to benefit a wide range of industries. Today, robots are in use everywhere around the globe, from college clubs to Fortune 100s. Companies and individuals alike are harnessing the power of robotics more than ever before, with the value of the Global Robotics Market rising to over 27 billion USD in 2020.",
